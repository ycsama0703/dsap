<think>Given DLTR's low beta of 0.518863 and negative Gat (-0.190397) indicating declining asset growth, the stock presents low systematic risk but weak fundamental momentum. The fund's current holding is modest relative to AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, suggesting limited active positioning. With low profitability (profit=0.331691) and negative asset growth, a defensive investor might reduce exposure slightly to align with the weak fundamentals, leading to a small negative normalized log change.</think>
