<think>Given RJF's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability and growth, but its high beta indicates elevated systematic risk. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight suggests limited benchmark-driven pressure. Considering the high beta and the fund's low turnover constraint, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the stock's market importance, though the elevated risk may temper the magnitude.</think>
