<think>Given MU's high beta of 1.65 and moderate profitability, the stock presents higher systematic risk than the market, which may lead to a cautious adjustment. The fund's current holding is substantial relative to its AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, suggesting potential for a reduction to manage concentration and align with the low-risk profile. The elevated stock volatility and recent trading volume could also prompt a rebalancing towards lower risk assets.</think>
