<think>Given the firm's high beta of 2.05, indicating significant market sensitivity, and its current holding being relatively small compared to AUM, a fund with low risk tolerance might reduce exposure to manage volatility. The stock's high previous quarter volatility (9.96) further supports a potential decrease to align with the investor's risk aversion. Considering the benchmark weight and the fund's active management context, a modest reduction in holding is expected to balance risk while maintaining alignment with the benchmark.</think>
