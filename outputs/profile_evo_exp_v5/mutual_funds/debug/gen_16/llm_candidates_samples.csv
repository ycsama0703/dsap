<think>Given the firm's moderate profitability (profit=0.29) and negative growth in total assets (Gat=-0.51), alongside a beta above 1 indicating higher systematic risk than the market, the stock presents mixed signals for fundamental investors.

Considering the high beta and negative growth, a modest reduction in holding might be expected to align with risk management, but the low current position and positive profitability could temper the magnitude of any decrease.</think>
