<think>Given the low beta of 0.837, the stock is relatively less volatile than the market, which typically reduces active risk for a benchmark-oriented fund. The current holding is substantial relative to the AUM and the stock's small S&P 500 weight, suggesting the fund may adjust to align closer with the benchmark's lower allocation, potentially leading to a modest decrease in holding.
