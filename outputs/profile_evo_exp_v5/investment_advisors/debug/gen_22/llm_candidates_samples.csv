<think>Given ADI's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability and growth, but its beta above 1 indicates higher systematic risk than the market.

Considering the high beta and moderate profitability, a modest reduction in holding might be expected to manage risk, though the low benchmark weight limits the magnitude.</think>
