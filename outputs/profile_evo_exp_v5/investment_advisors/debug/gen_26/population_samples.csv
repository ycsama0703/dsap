<think>Given EQT's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability and asset growth, with a beta below 1 indicating lower systematic risk than the market. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, suggesting potential for modest adjustment towards benchmark alignment. Considering the low risk profile and the fund's existing low exposure, a slight increase in holding might be expected to align closer to the benchmark weight, but the magnitude would likely be limited by the fund's low starting position and the stock's already modest volatility.</think>
