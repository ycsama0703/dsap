<think>Given ALB's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability and negative asset growth, alongside a beta above 1 indicating higher systematic risk than the market. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight suggests limited benchmark-driven pressure. Considering the mixed signals on profitability and growth, combined with elevated beta, a modest reduction in the normalized holding might be expected to manage risk exposure, but the magnitude would likely be tempered by the stock's low benchmark weight and the fund's substantial overall AUM.</think>
