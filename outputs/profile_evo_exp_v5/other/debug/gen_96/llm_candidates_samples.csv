The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight indicates limited benchmark-driven pressure. With moderate risk and positive profitability, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the fund's scale and the stock's stable profile, though the low beta and existing small position may limit the magnitude.</think>
