<think>Given DRI's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability and negative asset growth, with a low beta suggesting lower systematic risk than the market. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, indicating limited active exposure. Considering the low beta and mixed profitability signals, a modest adjustment in line with benchmark weight might be expected, but the magnitude would likely be small due to the fund's existing low position and the stock's low market importance.</think>
