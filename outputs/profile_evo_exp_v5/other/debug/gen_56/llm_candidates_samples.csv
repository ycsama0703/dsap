<think>Given ZBRA's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability (profit=0.394) but negative asset growth (Gat=-0.100), which may temper positive momentum. The stock's high beta (1.548) indicates above-market volatility, and its very low S&P 500 weight (0.00017) suggests limited benchmark-driven demand. Considering the fund's substantial AUM relative to the position size, any adjustment is likely to be modest due to the stock's small market presence and mixed signals from profitability and growth.</think>
