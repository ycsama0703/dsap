<think>Given the firm's moderate profitability and positive asset growth, alongside its above-market beta indicating higher systematic risk, the stock may attract some attention for its defensive characteristics. However, the fund's current holding is already substantial relative to AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight suggests limited benchmark-driven demand. Therefore, any adjustment is likely to be modest, possibly a slight increase to align with the firm's fundamentals but constrained by the existing large position and the fund's overall scale.</think>
