<think>Given KR's current fundamentals, the firm shows moderate profitability and low asset growth, with a beta slightly below 1 indicating lower systematic risk than the market. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, suggesting limited active exposure. Considering the low growth and modest profitability, alongside the fund's existing low position, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align closer to the benchmark weight, but the magnitude would likely be small due to the stock's already low beta and the fund's overall low turnover constraint.</think>
