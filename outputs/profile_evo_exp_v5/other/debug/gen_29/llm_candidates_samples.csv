<think>Given DRI's current fundamentals, the firm shows solid profitability (profit=0.456) and a low beta (0.342), suggesting stable performance with lower systematic risk. The fund's current holding is substantial relative to its AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, indicating a meaningful existing exposure. Considering the low beta and positive profitability, alongside the fund's high AUM and the stock's modest S&P 500 weight, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the benchmark while managing concentration, though the magnitude would likely be limited by the fund's existing large position.</think>
