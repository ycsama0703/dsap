<think>Given the firm's moderate profitability and positive asset growth, alongside its high beta indicating above-market risk, the stock may attract some attention for its defensive qualities. However, the fund's current holding is already substantial relative to AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight suggests limited benchmark-driven demand. Considering the high portfolio turnover constraint and the existing large position, a modest reduction in holding might be expected to manage concentration and align with the fund's low-turnover strategy.</think>
