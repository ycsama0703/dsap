<think>Given APD's high market capitalization relative to book equity and strong profitability, the firm appears fundamentally sound. The fund's current holding is substantial relative to its AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight suggests limited benchmark-driven pressure. With moderate beta and recent positive profitability, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the firm's solid fundamentals, though the high existing position and low benchmark weight may limit the magnitude.</think>
