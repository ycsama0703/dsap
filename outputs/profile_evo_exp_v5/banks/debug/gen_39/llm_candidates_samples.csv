<think>Given CNC's current fundamentals, the firm has a moderate market capitalization relative to book equity and positive profitability, but its beta is below 1, suggesting lower systematic risk than the market. The fund's current holding is a small fraction of AUM, and the stock's S&P 500 weight is minimal, indicating limited benchmark-driven pressure. With low stock volatility and moderate growth, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the fund's growth orientation, though the magnitude would likely be constrained by the stock's low benchmark weight and the fund's existing small position.</think>
