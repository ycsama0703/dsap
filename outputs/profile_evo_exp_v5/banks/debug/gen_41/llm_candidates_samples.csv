<think>Given DAL's current fundamentals, the company shows positive profitability but declining asset growth, with a beta below 1 indicating lower systematic risk than the market. The fund's current holding is modest relative to its AUM and the stock's S&P 500 weight, suggesting room for adjustment. Considering the low beta and positive profit margin, a slight increase in holding might be expected to align with the benchmark weight, but the magnitude would likely be small due to the stock's already low volatility and the fund's existing exposure.</think>
