<think>Given LMT's current fundamentals, the company shows strong profitability (profit=1.0366) and a moderate negative growth in assets (Gat=-0.0765), suggesting stable but not rapidly expanding operations. The fund's current holding is substantial relative to its AUM, and the stock's low beta (0.814) indicates lower systematic risk than the market. Considering the positive profit signal and the fund's large existing position, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the stock's positive fundamentals, though the low beta and moderate growth could temper the magnitude of any adjustment.</think>
