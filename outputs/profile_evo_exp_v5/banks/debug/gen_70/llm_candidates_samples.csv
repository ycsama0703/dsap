<think>Given the firm's moderate profitability (profit=0.513) and positive asset growth (Gat=0.045), along with a beta below 1 indicating lower systematic risk than the market, the stock appears fundamentally sound. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight suggests limited benchmark-driven pressure. Considering the positive fundamentals and manageable risk profile, a modest increase in the normalized log holding might be expected, but the magnitude would likely be tempered by the stock's already elevated recent volatility and the fund's existing low position.</think>
