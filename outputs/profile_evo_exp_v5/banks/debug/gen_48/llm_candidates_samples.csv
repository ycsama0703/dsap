<think>Given the firm's high profitability (profit=0.35) and positive asset growth (Gat=0.04), along with its above-market beta (1.25) indicating higher systematic risk, a growth-oriented investor might increase exposure to capture potential upside. However, the current holding is already substantial relative to AUM, and the stock's high volatility (0.13) and recent trading volume suggest elevated risk, which could temper the magnitude of any increase.
