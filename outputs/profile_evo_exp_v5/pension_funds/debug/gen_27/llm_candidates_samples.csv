<think>Given RJF's high beta of 1.565, the stock is more volatile than the market, which may lead to increased trading activity due to its elevated risk profile. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM and the stock's low S&P 500 weight, suggesting limited benchmark-driven pressure. With positive profitability and moderate asset growth, the stock fundamentals are supportive, but the high beta and low benchmark weight imply that any adjustment would likely be modest in magnitude, possibly a slight increase to align with the firm's growth prospects.</think>

With high beta indicating elevated systematic risk and the fund's capacity to increase positions, a modest increase in holding might be expected to capture growth opportunities while managing risk through the high beta.</think>
