However, its beta is slightly below 1 (0.93), suggesting lower systematic risk than the market, which might not drive strong active positioning. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM, and the stock's low S&P 500 weight indicates limited benchmark-driven demand. Considering the modest growth signals and the fund's existing low allocation, a slight increase in holding might be expected to align with the positive fundamentals, but the magnitude would likely be modest due to the stock's already low benchmark weight and the fund's overall scale.","{""holding_log_delta"": -0.03}"
