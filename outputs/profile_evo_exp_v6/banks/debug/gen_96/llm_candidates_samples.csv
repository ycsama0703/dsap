<think>Given DRI's current fundamentals, the firm shows strong profitability (profit=0.439) and positive asset growth (Gat=0.075), which are favorable signals. The fund's current holding is relatively small compared to its AUM, and the stock's low beta suggests lower systematic risk, potentially allowing for increased allocation without significant risk exposure. Considering the positive fundamentals and the fund's capacity to adjust positions, a modest increase in holding might be expected to align with the positive growth signals, though the magnitude would likely be limited by the stock's already elevated S&P 500 weight.</think>
