The stock's beta near 1 suggests market-average systematic risk, while its very low S&P 500 weight (0.0132%) implies it is a small component of the broad market. The fund's current holding is $1,445 relative to an AUM of $3.85M, representing a significant concentration (~37.5% of AUM), which is unusually high and may prompt rebalancing to reduce idiosyncratic risk.
